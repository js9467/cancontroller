## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "No COM port found"

**Try these in order:**

1. **Different cable** - Many USB-C cables are charge-only
2. **Different USB port** - Try USB 2.0 (black ports) instead of USB 3.0 (blue)
3. **Unplug and replug** - Wait 5 seconds between
4. **Close other programs** - Arduino IDE, PuTTY, serial monitors
5. **Restart computer** - Sometimes Windows needs a fresh start

### Zadig doesn't show my device

1. In Zadig: **Options** → **List All Devices** ✅
2. Look for these names:
   - "USB JTAG/serial debug unit"
   - "USB Composite Device"
   - Anything with "303A" in the name
3. If you see nothing, unplug/replug and check again

### "Access Denied" / "Permission Denied"

- Run QuickSetup.bat as Administrator
- Close programs using COM port
- Unplug/replug device
